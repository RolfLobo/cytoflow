    """
    Convert a binary gating strategy into a categorical condition.
    
    Binary gating strategies are quite common while doing manual gating.
    For example, a gating strategy might be "if a monocyte is CD64-, CD19+, 
    and CD3-, then it is a B cell; if it is CD64+, it is a macrophage". 
    Analyzing these data sets is often easier if one can specify a set of
    gate memberships, for example making a categorical variable with the
    values ``B_Cell`` and ``Macrophage``.
    
    If the gating strategy is strictly hierarchical, then you can use 
    `HierarchyOp` to accomplish this easily. For more complicated situations, 
    there is `CategoryOp`. `CategoryOp` is configured with a `dict` that maps 
    query strings to categories. `pandas.DataFrame.query` is called on each 
    query string in turn; the rows from `Experiment.data` that are returned 
    are assigned the corresponding category in the new categorical condition 
    that is created. **These subsets must be mutually exclusive,** a 
    requirement which is enforced by the operation. 
    
    Any event that is in none of the subsets is set to a default value, which
    defaults to ``Unknown``. 
    
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new condition in the
        experiment that's created by `apply`.
        
    subsets : Dict(Str : Str)
        The dictionary of query strings and their corresponding categories.
        
    default : Str (default = "Unknown")
        The name that unclassified events will have in the new categorical
        condition.

        
    Examples
    --------
    Make a little data set.
