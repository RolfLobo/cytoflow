    """
    Convert a hierarchical (binary) gating strategy into a categorical condition.
    
    Hierarchical gating strategies are quite common when doing manual gating.
    For example, an 8-stain panel can separate monocytes into macrophages, B cells,
    NK cells, NKT cells, T cells, DCs, and neutrophils -- but then, because these
    states are mutually exclusive, a reasonable question is "how much of each are there?"
    ``Cytoflow`` can define these gates, but because it does not have any 
    concept of nested gates, plotting and analyzing this gating strategy can be
    challenging, particularly in the GUI.
    
    `HierarchyOp` converts a list of gates into a categorical variable to
    enable straightforward analysis. For example, monocytes stained with CD64, 
    CD3 and CD19 can differentiate between macrophages and B cells. A user
    defines a `ThresholdOp` gate to separate CD64+ cells (macrophages) from the
    rest of the events, then they use a `PolygonOp` to distinguish the CD19+/CD3-
    cells (B cells) from everything else. `HierarchyOp` can take these two gates
    and create a categorical condition with the values ``Macrophages``, ``B_Cells``,
    and ``Unknown``.
    
    The operation is set up by providing a list of conditions, values for those
    conditions, and the category that condition indicates. Figuring out an 
    event's category is done by evaluating the hierarchical gates **in order.**
    For each event, the first condition/value pair is considered. If that event
    has that value, its new category is set accordingly. If not, then the next
    gate in the list is considered. If the event is a member in none of the gates,
    it receives the category listed in the `default` attribute.
    
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new condition in the
        experiment that's created by `apply`.
        
    gates : List(Tuple(Str, Any, Str))
        The ordered list of gates that implement the gating hierarchy. 
        Each three-tuple has the following format:
        
        * ``Str`` - the *name* of the gating operation. (Must be a key in
          `Experiment.conditions` and a column in `Experiment.data`)
          
        * ``Any`` - the *value* that the gate has to have to indicate membership
          in this class.
          
        * ``Str`` - the name of this class's category, to put in the new condition.
        
    default : Str (default = "Unknown")
        The name that unclassified events will have in the new categorical
        condition.
