    """
    A view that creates a minimum spanning tree view of a statistic. 
    Set `statistic` to the name of the statistic to plot; set `feature` to the name
    of that statistic's feature you'd like to analyze.
    
    Setting `location` to the features containing the values used to compute the "distance"
    between nodes in the tree (for example, the locations of cluster centroid.)
    
    There are three different ways of plotting the value at each location in tree: 
    
    * Leave `variable` set to ``None``, and a "traditional" heat map is produced, 
      where each node is a circle and the color of the circle is related to the 
      intensity of the value of `feature`.
      
    * Setting `variable` to a variable of the statistic and `type` to **pie** will
      draw a pie plot in each cell. The values in the `huefacet` are used as the
      categories of the pie, and the arc length of each slice of pie is related 
      to the intensity of the value of `feature`.
      
    * Setting `variable` to a variable of the statistic and `type` to **petal** will
      draw a "petal plot" in each cell. The values of the index level form the 
      categories, but unlike a pie plot, the arc width of each slice remains 
      equal. Instead, the radius of the pie slice scales with the square root 
      of the intensity, so that the relationship between area and intensity 
      remains the same.
      
    Optionally, you can set `size_feature` to scale the circles (or pies or petals)
    by another feature of the statistic. (Often used to scale by the count of a particular
    population or subset.)
