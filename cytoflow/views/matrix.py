    """
    A view that creates a matrix view (a 2D grid representation) of a statistic. 
    Set `statistic` to the name of the statistic to plot; set `feature` to the name
    of that statistic's feature you'd like to analyze.
    
    Setting `xfacet` and `yfacet` to levels of the statistic's index will result in
    a separate column or row for each value of that statistic.
    
    There are three different ways of plotting the values of the matrix view 
    (the "cells" in the matrix), controlled by the `type` parameter:
    
    * Setting `style` to ``heat`` (the default) will produce a "traditional" heat map, 
      where each "cell" is a circle and the color of the circle is related to the 
      intensity of the value of `feature`. (In this scenario, `variable` must be left empty.).
      
    * Setting `style` to ``pie`` will draw a pie plot in each cell. The values of `variable`
      are used as the categories of the pie, and the arc length of each slice of pie is related 
      to the intensity of the value of `feature`.
      
    * Set `style` to ``petal`` will draw a "petal plot" in each cell. The values of `variable` 
      are used as the categories, but unlike a pie plot, the arc width of each slice
      is equal. Instead, the radius of the pie slice scales with the square root of
      the intensity, so that the relationship between area and intensity remains the same.
          
    Optionally, you can set `size_feature` to scale the circles' (or pies or petals)' area
    by another feature of the statistic. For example, you might scale the size of each
    circle by the number of events in some subset. For the ``heat`` style, this is 
    enough -- but for ``pie`` or ``petal`` plots, you need to *reduce* the feature
    (because there is only one pie plot, but there are multiple slices of the pie.)
    Set `size_function` to a callable that takes a `pandas.Series` as an argument and returns
    a ``float``.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    
    variable : Str
        The variable used for plotting pie and petal plots. Must be left empty
        for a heatmap.
        
    feature : Str
        The column in the statistic to plot (often a channel name.)
        
    style : Enum(``heat``, ``pie``, ``petal``) (default = ``heat``)
        What kind of matrix plot to make?
        
    size_feature : String
        Which feature to use to scale the size of the circle/pie/petal?
        
    size_function : String
        If `size_feature` is set and `style` is ``pie`` or ``petal``, this function
        is used to reduce `size_feature` before scaling the pie plots. The function 
        should take a `pandas.Series` and return a ``float``. Often something like
        ``lambda x: x.sum()``.
        
    TODO - just change this to size_function...? apply to a frame group.
