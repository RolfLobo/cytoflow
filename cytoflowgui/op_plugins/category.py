Categorical Gating
------------------

Convert a binary gating strategy into a categorical condition.

Binary gating strategies are quite common while doing manual gating.
For example, a gating strategy might be "if a monocyte is CD64-, CD19+, 
and CD3-, then it is a B cell; if it is CD64+, it is a macrophage". 
Analyzing these data sets is often easier if one can specify a set of
gate memberships, for example making a categorical variable with the
values ``B_Cell`` and ``Macrophage``.

If the gating strategy is strictly hierarchical, then you can use 
``Hierarchical Gating`` operation to accomplish this easily. For more 
complicated situations, there is ``Categorical Gating``. This operation
is configured with a list of subsets and the name to give each subset.
**These subsets must be mutually exclusive,** a requirement which is 
enforced by the operation. A new categorical variable is then created,
whose categories are the names and each of which is applied to events
in the category's subset.

Any event that is in none of the subsets is set to a default value, which
defaults to `Unknown`. 
    
.. object:: Name

        The name of the new condition that this operation creates.

.. object:: Subsets

        The mutually exclusive subsets that will be assigned categories. For 
        each, you need to specify:
        
        * The *name* of the new category
          
        * The *subset* of events that should be assigned that category.
                  
.. object:: Default 

        The name that unclassified events will have in the new categorical
        condition.
