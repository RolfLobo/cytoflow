Hierarchical Gating
-------------------

Convert a hierarchical (binary) gating strategy into a categorical condition.

Hierarchical gating strategies are quite common when doing manual gating.
For example, an 8-stain panel can separate monocytes into macrophages, B cells,
NK cells, NKT cells, T cells, DCs, and neutrophils -- but then, because these
states are mutually exclusive, a reasonable question is "how much of each are there?"
``Cytoflow`` can define these gates, but because it does not have any 
concept of nested gates, plotting and analyzing this gating strategy can be
challenging.

The ``Hierarchy`` operation converts a list of gates into a categorical variable to
enable straightforward analysis. For example, monocytes stained with CD64, 
CD3 and CD19 can differentiate between macrophages and B cells. A user
defines a threshold gate to separate CD64+ cells (macrophages) from the
rest of the events, then they use a polygon gate to distinguish the CD19+/CD3-
cells (B cells) from everything else. The ``Hierarchy`` operation can take these two gates
and create a categorical condition with the values ``Macrophages``, ``B_Cells``,
and ``Unknown``.

The operation is set up by providing a list of conditions, values for those
conditions, and the category that condition indicates. Figuring out an 
event's category is done by evaluating the hierarchical gates **in order.**
For each event, the first condition/value pair is considered. If that event
has that value, its new category is set accordingly. If not, then the next
gate in the list is considered. If the event is a member in none of the gates,
it receives the category listed in the ``Default`` attribute.
    
.. object:: Name

        The name of the new condition that this operation creates.

.. object:: Gates

        The ordered list of gates that implement the gating hierarchy. 
        For each, you need to specify:
        
        * The *name* of the pre-existing condition
          
        * The *value* that the condition has to have to indicate membership
          in this class.
          
        * The name of the new *category*.
        
.. object:: Default 

        The name that unclassified events will have in the new categorical
        condition.
