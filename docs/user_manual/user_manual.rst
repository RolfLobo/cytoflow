.. note:: If there's something you'd like to do that isn't well-explained
          by the user manual, please `file an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow>`_.

The **User Manual** is divided into four sections:

#. :ref:`Tutorials <user_tutorials>` are step-by-step examples to get you 
   started using Cytoflow.  They include both some basic tutorials as well 
   as examples of some more advanced analyses.
      
#. :ref:`HOWTOs <user_howto>` are "recipes" -- step-by-step guides to 
   accomplish a particular task.  They are a little higher-level than 
   the tutorials. 

#. :ref:`Guides <user_guides>` help you understand some of the principles 
   Cytoflow is based on and some subtler points about using it to analyze 
   flow cytometry data. They can help you use Cytoflow more effectively!   
      
#. :ref:`Reference documents <user_reference>` for each operation and
   view in Cytoflow.  These are the same documents that appear in the
   **Help** pane in the user interface.
