HOWTO: Spin a new release
=========================

Set up a build environment
--------------------------

Using Anaconda, create a build environment and install the current source::

     conda env create --name cf_build --file package/environment-build.yml
     conda activate cf_dev
     pip install --editable .

Tests
-----

- We use two continuous integration platforms to run tests and build binaries and documentations:
  `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/actions>`_, 
  `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/projects/cytoflow/>`_.
  
  Finished releases are published to `GitHub releases <https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/releases>`_,
  `Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/cytoflow>`_, and the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/cytoflow/>`_.
  
- Make sure that the :mod:`cytoflow` tests pass, both locally and on GitHub::

  	  nose2 -c package/nose2.cfg cytoflow.tests 
  	  
- Run the same tests but saving figures, and scroll through to make sure nothing is
  too strange::
  
      nose2 -c package/nose2.cfg --saveFigures figs.pdf cytoflow.tests
  
- Make sure the :mod:`cytoflowgui` tests pass.  
  **You must do this locally; I'm still working on why it doesn't run on the CI platform.** ::

  	  nose2 -c package/nose2.cfg cytoflowgui.tests
  	  
- Make sure the GitHub Actions are running to completion at 
  https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/actions
  	  
    
Documentation
-------------
  
- Build the user manual and check it for completeness::

      sphinx-build docs/ build/manual
      sphinx-build docs/user_manual/reference cytoflowgui/help
  	  
- Make sure that the ReadTheDocs build is working at 
  https://readthedocs.org/projects/cytoflow/builds/


  	  
Test the packaging
------------------
  	  
- Build the conda package locally::
	
      conda build package/conda_recipes/cytoflow
      
- Install the local package in a new environment::

      conda create --name cytoflow.test --use-local cytoflow
      
- Activate the test environment, make sure you can import cytoflow, and make sure the GUI runs::

      conda activate cytoflow.test
      python -c "import cytoflow"
      cytoflow    

- Make sure that the :mod:`pyinstaller` distribution will build and run on your local 
  machine (back in your development environment).  ::

  	  pyinstaller package/pyinstaller.spec 
  	  dist/cytoflow/cytoflow
  
- Make sure that :mod:`pyinstaller` built the executables on all three supported
  platforms. On each of the three supported platforms:
  
  * Download the one-click from GitHub Actions. Make sure it starts and can execute a basic workflow.
  * Download the conda package from GitHub Actions. Create a local ``anaconda`` environment and install it.
    Check that it runs as both a module and a GUI ::
  
      conda env create --name cf.test -f environment.yml
      conda activate cf.test
      conda install ./cytoflow-*******-tar.bz2
      python -c "import cytoflow"
      cytoflow

Versioning and dependencies
---------------------------

- We're using ``setuptools-scm`` to manage versions.  No manual versions required.

- If there are dependencies that don't have packages on Anaconda, add recipes
  to ``package/conda_recipes`` (using ``conda skeleton``) and upload them to
  the Anaconda Cloud.  Unless there's a really (really!) good reason, please
  make them no-arch.
  
- Make sure ``install_requires`` in ``pyproject.toml`` matches ``environment.yml``

.. note::
   You don't have to set version numbers!
  	
- Update the version integers in ``package/installer.nsis``
  	
Tag and upload the release
--------------------------
  
- Push the updated files (probably just ``installer.nsis``) to GitHub.  
Give the CI builders ~30 minutes, then check the build status on GitHub and 
ReadTheDocs.

- Create a new tag on the master branch.  This will re-build everything on the CI
  builders.

- Download the artifacts.

Sign the Windows installer
--------------------------
To get rid of the "Unknown developer" warning in Windows, we sign the installer.
This requires a hardware crypto token, so it must be done locally.

- Setup: If not done already, download and install the Windows Platform SDK. I'm using 8.1 
  because I couldn't get 10 to install.

- Download the Windows installer from Github.

- Open a terminal in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin.

- Start the signing wizard::

    signtool.exe signwizard
    
- Select the installer binary.  

- Under "Signing options", choose "Typical"

- Under "Signature Certificate", choose "Select from store...".  If the hardware key is installed 
  and set up properly, Windows should find the correct certificate.
  
- Add a description such as "Flow cytometry software".  For "Web location", specify "http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org"

- Check the box next to "Add a timestamp to data".  Enter "http://time.certum.pl".  (Probably could use digicert or some other service.)

- When prompted, enter the Common Profile PIN.

- After the wizard closes, double-check that the signing process was completed by right-clicking on the executable and checking the "Digital Signatures" tab.

Sign the Mac applications
-------------------------
Recent versions of MacOS will simply refuse to run an unsigned application. Some day we may have this
in the CI, but at the moment it must be done locally -- and the *build* has to happen on the same machine
that the *signing* does. Ugh.

- Following `the installation instructions on ReadTheDocs <https://cytoflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev_manual/howto/install.html#to-hack-on-the-code>`_, 
  build a developer environment and make sure it works.

- Following `the release instructions on ReadTheDocs <https://cytoflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev_manual/howto/release.html>`_, build the online help
  docs and the .app bundle.

- Following `this gist <https://gist.github.com/bpteague/750906b9a02094e7389427d308ba1002>`_, sign and notarize the .app bundle. Zip it back up with
  ``ditto`` and upload it to the GitHub release.

Update the homepage
--------------------------------------------

- At https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow.github.io, update the version in 
  ``_config.yml``. Push these changes to update the main download links on 
  http://cytoflow.github.io/
  
- Verify that the download links at http://cytoflow.github.io/ still work!
